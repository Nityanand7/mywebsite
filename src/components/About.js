      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
      Hello! Iâ€™m Nityanand, a passionate technologist with a love for all things data. My journey began with a simple fascination with video games, which sparked a curiosity about how computers work. This curiosity grew into a deep dive into the world of technology, leading me to pursue both a Bachelorâ€™s and a Masterâ€™s degree in the field.</p>
      <br></br>
      <p>Over the years, Iâ€™ve explored a wide range of tech domains, but my heart lies in the realm of data. From Data Analytics to Data Engineering, Data Science, and Machine Learning, Iâ€™m captivated by the power of data to tell stories and drive decisions. Add to that my interest in AI and Cloud technologies, and youâ€™ve got someone whoâ€™s constantly excited about shaping the future with innovative solutions.
